 1. #### The syntax of "***data_info.dt***"
> - `"\n"` separates the lines.
> - `"[-]"` separates the dates and other info.  
> This must only be used once in each line (day).  
> - `"[*]"` separates tasks in each day.
> - `"[@]"` separates task names, data, and time from each other.  
> 
> **Be sure to note that the data after parsing from the `.dt` file will become a dictionary with dates as keys**
